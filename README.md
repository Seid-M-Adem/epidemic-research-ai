# Features

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Load and preprocess epidemic data from raw CSV files.
Data Imputation: Handle missing data in epidemic datasets using different strategies (mean, median, mode).
Literature Fetching: Automatically fetch relevant literature from PubMed or specified URLs.
Literature Review: Generate a literature review section based on the fetched research.
Report Generation: Generate a complete scientific paper in both PDF and Word formats.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git (for cloning the repository)
GitHub Codespaces (for development environment)

# 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/epidemic-research-ai.git
cd epidemic-research-ai

# 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes:

text
Copy code
pandas
fpdf
python-docx
requests
beautifulsoup4

# 3. Set Up GitHub Codespaces (Optional)

This project is optimized for GitHub Codespaces. If using Codespaces, the necessary environment setup is handled automatically using the devcontainer.json file.

To configure your environment manually:

Ensure that Docker is installed (optional).
Set up the environment using devcontainer.json or Dockerfile.

# 4. Data

Place your epidemic research dataset (CSV format) in the /data/raw/ folder. The provided example is real_epidemic_data.csv, which mimics daily epidemic data such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations.

Example dataset: /data/raw/real_epidemic_data.csv

csv
Copy code
date,country,confirmed_cases,deaths,recovered,vaccinated
2024-01-01,CountryX,1000,10,100,500
2024-01-02,CountryX,2000,25,200,1000
2024-01-03,CountryX,3000,40,300,1500
...

# Running the Project

## 1. Main Pipeline
Run the main pipeline to execute the entire process:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The pipeline will:

Load and preprocess the data from /data/raw/real_epidemic_data.csv.
Impute missing values in the dataset (using the mean strategy by default).
Fetch relevant literature from provided URLs (PubMed, for example).
Generate a scientific report in both PDF and Word formats.
The final reports will be saved in the /reports/ directory:

/reports/full_paper.pdf
/reports/full_paper.docx

## 2. Steps in the Pipeline

### 2.1 Data Loading & Preprocessing

The data loading and preprocessing steps are handled by the script:

bash
Copy code
src/data_processing.py
It loads the CSV file from /data/raw/ and preprocesses it for further use.

### 2.2 Data Imputation

To handle missing values in the dataset, the following script is used:

bash
Copy code
src/data_imputation.py
It supports different imputation strategies (mean, median, mode).

### 2.3 Literature Fetching

Relevant literature is fetched from PubMed or other specified URLs using:

bash
Copy code
src/literature_fetcher.py
You can add new URLs to fetch more literature and build your review.

### 2.4 Literature Review

Once the literature is fetched, the review is generated using:

bash
Copy code
src/literature_review.py

### 2.5 Report Generation

The final report, which includes the introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion, is generated by:

bash
Copy code
src/report_generator.py
This script generates both a PDF and Word document.

# Example Output

After running the main pipeline, two files will be generated in the /reports folder:

full_paper.pdf: A scientific paper in PDF format.
full_paper.docx: A scientific paper in Word format.
The report includes sections such as Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References.

# Jupyter Notebooks

For exploratory data analysis or custom model development, use the notebooks available in the /notebooks/ directory. These are designed to work within the project structure and allow for interactive analysis of the epidemic data.

# Future Enhancements

AI Modeling: Incorporate machine learning models to predict the spread of the epidemic based on the dataset.
Data Visualization: Add support for epidemic data visualization (charts, graphs).
API Integration: Fetch real-time epidemic data from APIs such as WHO or CDC.
